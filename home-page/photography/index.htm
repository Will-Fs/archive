            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                &emsp; My journey as a photographer started in 2017 when I received an iPhone X as a Christmas gift. 
                I began taking pictures whenever I could, taking dozens every single day. I watched countless videos
                on how to take photographs and edit them on my iPhone. I began getting results I was pleased with, especially
                considering how little experience I had with the topic.

                <img class="phone" src="images/phone1.jpg">

            <p class = "caption">photos taken with my iPhone X</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I then got into Astrophotography with my parents' old point-and-shoot camera with help from friends on Twitter. I quickly
                got the hang of it but immediately felt limited by the camera.

            <p class = "caption">a photo taken on my parents' camera</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Later, I purchased a Sony a6000 in December of 2019.

            <p class="caption">the first photograph taken with my Sony a6000</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I did mainly astrophotography with it for a while, but also dabbled in other areas of photography.
