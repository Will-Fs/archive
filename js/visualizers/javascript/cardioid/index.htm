        <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
        <br>
        <p align="center">This algorithm works by drawing lines between dots
            which are moving around a circle. </p>
        <p align="left">
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp; To start off, 1000
            dots are placed around a larger circle, spaced equally.
            Dots are paired with the dot positioned directly across
            from it on the circle. 
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;Next, each dot is given a speed
            at which it moves around the larger circle. The speed given
            is determined by raising the number to which number the dot corresponds
            to a cetain power.
            For example when the power is 2, the 1st dot is given a speed of 1 unit,
            the 2nd dot is given a speed of 4 units, the 3rd is
            given a speed of 9 units, and so on. If the power was 3, the speed of the
            2nd dot would be 8.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;As a dot moves, a line
            is drawn between it and the dot to which it was paired
            at the start of the process. When the power to which a dot's
            speed is raised is equal to 2, the shape created by the lines
            after a determined amount of time - when a designated dot(the one you
            can see moving around the circle) reaches a specific location - is a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid" target="_blank", title="Wikpedia">Cardioid</a>.
            As this power increases, different variations of cardioids are created.
            After letting the algorithm run for multiple revolutions, more complex variations
            of cardioids often seem to appear, overlapping simpler variations.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;In the first demonstration, the power remains constant but can be changed. 
            In the second demonstration, the power is slowly increasing and the patterns created
            by different powers can be seen.
